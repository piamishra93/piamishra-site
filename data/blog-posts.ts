      <h2 class="mt-12 mb-4 font-semibold text-xl">I. Context</h2>
      <p>
        The Philips Hue smart bulb was a happy accident of the mobile-first world that the release of the iPhone created.
        Philips’ phone-first lighting system was initially intended to shortcut lengthy hardware cycles and quickly
        prototype a remote control for an older generation of lamps.
      </p>
      <p>
        The development team realized, though, how powerful mobile phones could be in creating a convenient, flexible
        lighting system — giving rise to the smart bulbs we know and use today.
      </p>
      <p>
        In many ways, the creation of the Hue smart bulb is the 21st century evolution of Philips’ mission from the 1890s:
        creating cost-effective, reliable bulbs that pushed boundaries through the creative use of emerging technology.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-12 mb-4 font-semibold text-xl">II. Choices</h2>

      <h3 class="mt-12 mb-2 font-semibold text-lg">A | Consistent and classic bulb design</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Philips kept the shape of their smart devices consistent with what users recognize in standard LED & incandescent bulbs.
        Earlier energy-saving bulbs, like the CFL, offered futuristic designs that never really landed — in spite of providing
        a cost-efficient and sustainable option.</li>
        <li>Bulbs are often exposed in living spaces — this means visual appeal needs to match or exceed utility. Philips recognized
        this in opting for a traditional silhouette for their first smart bulbs, but have also expanded the lighting line over time
        to include a diverse portfolio of shapes for different environments.</li>
        <li>Taking advantage of & innovating with evolving lighting technology has also given Philips space to play with visual feel
        and experience without altering design.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="mt-12 mb-2 font-semibold text-lg">B | Dynamic tones to influence ambiance</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>LED bulbs historically emitted blue-toned light, making the spaces they were installed in feel sterile. Despite being more
        expensive, and worse for the environment, this often led users to incandescents when a cozier feel was needed.</li>
        <li>However, Hue bulbs allow for changes between warm and cool tones, in addition to supporting dimming of the light itself.
        Certain Hue devices also support colors beyond a standard white or yellow palette.</li>
        <li>These days, the Philips colored bulbs can even be configured to dynamically adjust to music in a room — a playful take on
        shaping experience with light.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="mt-12 mb-2 font-semibold text-lg">C | Simple but powerful mobile application</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The landing page of the Hue app is straightforward — it defaults to the controls for your bulbs and enables a simple
        on/off toggle for each device. However, there are entry points to more complex scene settings should users want to
        explore additional ambiances.</li>
        <li>While managing the experience once the bulbs are installed is clear, the setup process can be confusing — particularly
        if the bulbs are meant to plug into a broader home system. This may be a disadvantage of streamlined UI — it’s hard to
        know how or where to configure deeper functionality.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="mt-12 mb-4 font-semibold text-xl">III. Conclusions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Great, innovative design needn’t be conflated with overly complex, detailed or imaginative items — Philips Hue smart
        bulbs offer a lesson in balancing an innovative approach with a classic aesthetic.</li>
        <li>The bulbs are also one of the few products in the market that elegantly blend together physical and digital worlds.
        The mobile app mimics the bulbs — functional, simple, and well integrated into the ecosystem they are a part of.</li>
      </ul>
